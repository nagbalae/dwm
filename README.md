# dwm
A personal fork of dwm-6.2, kind of based on lukesmithxyz's and samedamci's forks.
The main aim of the fork is to be usable, be as universal as it can be and the colourschemes to be dynamically changeable on the run (the most important of them all ofc).
As of 2020 06 17 it works well with pywal.
