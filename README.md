# dwm
A personal fork of dwm-6.2, kind of based on lukesmithxyz's and with ideas from samedamci's forks.
I'm trying to replicate my i3's looks in dwm.
## ***If you haven't used dwm, you don't start with this.***
Go to [suckless' dwm page](https://dwm.suckless.org) or use [Luke's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm) or [Samedamci's](https://github.com/samedamci/dwm) forks.
=======
**_This fork has and probably will have utterly awful coding_, and the features are tailored to my usage, though i hope you'll have fun trying it.**
## How to use
- **before installing change termcmd's urxvt to your terminal!, otherwise you'll have no terminal!**
- after install use sxhkd or some other program to set your keybinds up
- make or download a statusbar script
- if you want to make the cool wallpaper changer script, use wal or something, it's a few lines! (don't forget to refresh dwm's colours at the end with 'xdotool key super+shift+F5' or equialent!)  
you are good to go, have fun!
## Features & Patches(mostly patches from suckless):
- Kinda compatible with pywal (use 'xdotool key super+shift+F5' at the end of the wallpaper changer script)
- Modkey is Super (Windows key)
- Works with picom
- Vanity-Gapps
- Xrdb (using color0,3,7)
- Vacant tags
- Sticky (super+s)
- Fullscreen (super+f)
- The rest you can see for yourself in the code!
## Todo:
- Swallow
- Add Layouts
