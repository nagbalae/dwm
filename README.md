# dwm
A personal fork of dwm-6.2, kind of based on lukesmithxyz's and samedamci's forks.  
The main aim of the fork is ***A E S T H E T I C S***.   
I'm trying to replicate my i3's looks in dwm.
## ***If you haven't used dwm, you don't start with this.***  
Go to [suckless' dwm page](https://dwm.suckless.org) or use [Luke's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm) or [Samedamci's](https://github.com/samedamci/dwm) forks.  
**_This fork has and probably will have utterly awful coding_, and the features are tailored to my usage, though i hope you'll have fun trying it.**
## Features (mostly patches from suckless):
- Kinda compatible with pywal (use 'xdotool key super+shift+F5' at the end of the wallpaper changer script)
- Modkey is Super (Windows key)
- Works with picom
- The rest you can see for yourself in the code!
## Todo:
- [ ] Move shortcuts to sxhkd
- [ ] Selection colour from Xresources
- [ ] Gapps
- [ ] Swallow
- [ ] Rotate stack
- [ ] Layouts
